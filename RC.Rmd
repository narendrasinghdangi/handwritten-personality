## 11.5 Reconciled distributional forecasts

Reconciled distributional forecasts are a type of probabilistic forecasting that involve reconciling or combining multiple individual forecasts, each with their own distributional assumptions, into a single coherent forecast with a distributional assumption that reflects the information from all the individual forecasts.

we will focus on two fundamental results that are implemented in the `reconcile()` function.

1.  If the base forecasts are normally distributed,

then the reconciled forecasts are also normally distributed,

where, S = Summing matrix

G = Reconciliation matrix

2)  When the assumption of normality is not reasonable for the base forecasts:

    we can use a non-parametric approach such as bootstrapping to generate a large number of possible future sample paths from the model(s) that produce the base forecasts. These sample paths represent a range of possible future outcomes based on the underlying model(s) and provide a way to estimate the distribution of the forecast errors.

    Once the sample paths are generated, we can then reconcile them using a reconciliation method such as hierarchical forecasting or Bayesian model averaging. This involves adjusting the individual sample paths to ensure that they are consistent with each other and with any known constraints or relationships between the variables being forecasted.

    After the sample paths are reconciled, we can compute coherent prediction intervals that reflect the uncertainty in the reconciled forecast. One way to do this is to compute quantiles of the reconciled sample paths at each future point in time.

    For example, if we generate 1,000 reconciled sample paths, we can compute the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the sample paths at each future point to obtain a 95% prediction interval.

    This approach allows us to account for the non-normality of the forecast errors and to incorporate the information from the base forecasts into a single, coherent forecast that reflects the collective knowledge and information of the individual forecasts.
